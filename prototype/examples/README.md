Examples
========

This directory contains minimal, end-to-end examples that showcase AI-assisted LaTeX workflows. Suggested structure for each example:

1. **Overview** — Goals, context, and related research notes.
2. **Prerequisites** — Required tools, datasets, or accounts.
3. **Step-by-step guide** — Clear instructions for reproducing the workflow.
4. **Outcome** — Screenshots, generated PDFs, or metrics (store large artifacts elsewhere if needed).
5. **Follow-up ideas** — Improvements or questions for contributors.

Keep examples concise and focused on illustrating a single concept. Link back to `research/` documents or issues for deeper discussion.

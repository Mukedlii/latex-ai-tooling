Scripts
=======

This folder stores automation scripts that experiment with AI-driven helpers for LaTeX workflows. Each script should include:

- Purpose and expected inputs/outputs.
- Setup instructions (dependencies, environment variables).
- Example usage commands.
- Notes on limitations or next steps.

Use subfolders when grouping related scripts (e.g., `log-analysis/`, `template-gen/`). Keep code modular so others can adapt components to different environments.

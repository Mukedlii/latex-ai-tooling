Configs
=======

Store reusable configuration assets here, such as:

- Continuous integration workflows (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure Pipelines).
- Editor configuration snippets (VS Code `settings.json`, Vim/Neovim mappings).
- Container or virtual environment definitions (Dockerfiles, devcontainers).

Each config should ship with:

- A short description of what problem it solves.
- Setup or installation instructions.
- Customization guidance and known compatibility notes.

When configs depend on secrets (API keys, tokens), document how to provide them securely without committing sensitive data.
